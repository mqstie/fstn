					From day one, ENU has been fully supportive of our project, 
					providing us with space to work in, and the freedom to ‘have a 
					go’. With this kind of backing, it is no surprise that ENU has 
					been steadily climbing the rankings in many of the league tables 
					in addition to receiving awards, demonstrating the University’s 
					dedication to its students.</p>

					mechanical problems, including static, dynamic, structural analysis, 
					heat and fluid problems), in addition to onboarding and training 
					programs. By incorporating Ansys into the design process, FSTN's 
					engineers aim to learn an industry-standard tool to further their 
					professional development, whilst elevating the optimisation of our 
					car's components.</p>
