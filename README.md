# Formula Student Team Napier - The Website

This repository stores the source code for the official Formula Student Team Napier site, with images and files required to run this site. 

## Motivation

Our old website used a popular website template and hosting company, which was quite costly on top of owning our domain, so naturally, once the resources and time allowed we decided to create our own site. This aids in cutting down costs within our PR department to allow for more funding to go towards the development of our competition car and AI programming teams.
