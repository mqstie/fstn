# Formula Student Team Napier

This repository is the home of the source code for the FSTN website. Learn more about the competition, our team, our amazing sponsors and how to join us! 

## Motivation

The motivation behind this website was formulated when a revamp for our outdated wix website was very much necessary. This change aided in keeping our information up-to-date and relevant, but also helped us redirect funding towards our technical and driverless teams.
