				<h3>THE COMPETITION</h3>
			</section>
		
			<section id="competitionInfo">
				<p>As the world's  largest and most established educational engineering 
				competition, Formula Student (FS, aka FSAE in North America) gives students 
				the opportunity to get hands-on experience in many aspects of the 
				engineering design process, which translate to real-world professional 
				skills. This includes facets like research & design, manufacturing & 
				testing, as well as marketing, managing finances and overall management.</p>
				
				<p>In the UK, the event is organised by the Institute of Mechanical 
				Engineers (IMechE) and held at the world-famous Silverstone circuit with over 
				100 teams attending. Here, the competition is split into 3 main classes: FS, 
				Concept & FS-AI.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>FS Class is the 'standard' class, where teams build and enter a 
					Formula-style race car.</li>
					<li>Concept Class is where teams can enter a concept rather than a full vehicle.</li>
					<li>FS-AI Class is where teams develop autonomous driving systems for a driverless 
					car. This can either be implemented on a borrowed driverless vehicle from IMechE 
					(known as the ADS-DV) via the DDT entry, or by building their own driverless 
					platform on their car, via the ADS entry.</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>OUR TEAM</h3>
			</section>
		
			<section id="teamInfo">
				<p>Formula Student Team Napier was founded on December 19th, 2021, and since then we have been 
				hard at work developing an internal combustion (IC) car, as well as autonomous driving 
				software which we implement on the IMechE ADS-DV vehicle.</p>
				
				<p>The team currently consists of 30+ students, who are spread across various roles in the 
				team split into 5 departments (technical, driverless, operations, PR & marketing, and finance). 
				Whilst our team is primarily engineering-focused, there are a lot of support roles that are 
				required in order to actually complete a project of this scale. This was developed with the 
				team ethos in mind, which is to provide an opportunity for any student passionate about the 
				project to be able to get involved with the team.</p>
